# Typewriter Project

This is a small Node.js script that prints a sentence character-by-character to the console, simulating a typewriter effect.

## How It Works

- Loops through each character in a sentence
- Uses `setTimeout` to delay output of each character
- Prints each character to the terminal using `process.stdout.write()`

## Example Output

H
e
l
l
o
...


## Run It

Make sure you're in the project folder:

```bash
node typewriter.js
